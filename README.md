YieldCat

Hi, my name is Deni. I was playing with YieldCat in the past couple of days and there are few things that I noticed.

The concept and the idea of the project is wonderful about people who want to learn and practice cybersecurity or ethical hacking.
The UI/UX design may be a little bit better, also noticed few simple bugs in the frontend and backend development.
There is one "'" next to the header nav, and I was triggered few times to remove it.
Also, when you search the bond id and open it, when you want to refresh the market data, the on click button function is not working properly.
I think there is some problem with the message "You are blocked, contact the owner..." when trying to exploit SQL injection or script tag.

First thing that is missing and came to my mind is the message component,
which I saw it later "coming soon", chatbot where hackers can ask questions (maybe for fun, because I like that error "You went full retard..."),
AI driven scenarios where investors chat with bonds and can exploit some extra vulnerabilities, or some games with guessing the right answer what to do in attacks, 
bigger documentation about what to do and how to protect yourselves from cyber attacks...

I am still working on that and trying to figure out more ideas while playing and learning, and I don't want to miss this opportunity,
because from everything I learned until now, this is the most exciting field of IT and I really love it.
I hope this is enough for now and will update it as soon as I have more ideas.
